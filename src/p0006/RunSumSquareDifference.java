/**
 * Implements a solution to Problem 6 on projecteuler.net
 * http://projecteuler.net/problem=6
 *
 * Task:
 * Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the
 * first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
 *
 * Runtime Complexity:
 * O(3n) where n is the number of natural numbers in the
 * calculation
 *    - One: calculate squares of natural numbers
 *    - Two: add squares to sum
 *    - Three: calculate sum of natural numbers
 *
 * Test Case:
 * The difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten
 * natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
